Usually after the long Boston winter, we\u2019re itching to bring out the bunnies, bonnets and yellow fluffy chicks and get on with our Springtime.\r\n\r\nThe Baby Tree is a real tree. This must be said. It dwells in Sexhow and carries cavorting baby-dolls and in season, a few pears appear. It belongs to great friends of Dann & Martha, and they chose to rescue these small plastic people from a landfill-fate by allowing them to ride in their pear-tree many years ago. And thank heavens they did.\r\n\r\nOur Baby Tree is a very magical, traveling tree filled with waving, happy babies, some of whom may or may not resemble Mikheil Gorbachev. There may also be some discrepancy in the number of limbs, but we cannot be sure where other baby heads may be poking through the leaves so we don\u2019t worry ourselves about it. If you want, read our poem about it.\r\n\r\nBaby Tree beer is a Pretty Things take on the best of Abbey-style brewing from Belgium. Inspired by monastic and abbey quadruples, embellished with dark fruit flavours, not too sweet, not too heavy, it\u2019s a springtime beer with some of the richness of late winter. It makes it perfect year round, so that\u2019s when we offer it! You should be able to find it most months of the year, on draft or in bottle.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it\u2019s our way of bringing a bit of Springtime to you and to us, all year round. Hooray!",

Batchlors Delight is named for one of the most notorious and important pirate ships in history. Captained by the infamous buccaneers Davis, Wafer and Hingson, who won the ship in a card game. After years of pirating in the Caribbean the trio were set on retiring in Virginia. They were arrested near Hampton Roads and spent nearly 3 years in prison.

The high alcohol shows itself visually with legs that stick to the glass when swirled. The aroma brings forth a bouquet of bourbon, vanilla and Belgian yeast characteristics. As it warms, a liquid dessert is brought forth with aromas similar to flan and bananas foster.\r\n\r\nThe flavor is sweet throughout without being cloying - a palate of sweet, sticky toffee with a nice dark fruit\/cherry parfait accompaniment. The barrel shows itself with bourbon and subtle chocolate notes with a soft tannic finish. A full bodied beer with a soft CO2 bite and alcohol that warms the throat without being aggressive.",

Bourbon Cru displays a sunset orange hue with a substantial head and brilliant clarity after months of barrel ageing. The maturity and melding of flavors brought on by the freshly drained, half-decade old Virginia bourbon barrels from Fredericksburg\u2019s A. Smith Bowman Distillery lends an extraordinary sense of harmony to Bourbon Cru. Almond toffee and oaky vanilla aromatics give way to dark cherries, raisins and mature whiskey. A bit of plum flavor is greeted by caramel overtones and an assertive yet incredibly rounded body and a lingering, bourbon-laced finish.",

Rivaling the complexity of the St.Bernardus Abt 12, St.Bernardus Christmas Ale offers a spicy, mint-like flavor profile exuding the tastes of warming alcohol, fermented molasses, apricots, licorice and marzipan that are highligted by the perfect balance of brewing sugars.\r\nThe perfect companion to enjoy a (cold?) winter evening, with or without the company of your friends!",
